Hi, my name is Blake. I am a family man, friend to all, adventurer, and lifetime learner.

Work: I am a backend data engineer with experience in on-prem and cloud technologies. I've been working at HCA Healthcare for 7 years in the enterprise data teams and have become proficient in SQL, Python/Bash scripting, and terraform infrastructure management.

    I specialize in:
    - Terraform infrastructure automation
    - BigQuery optimization and cost tracking
    - Serverless pipelines using Cloud Functions & Pub/Sub

Play:
- One can only look at a screen for so long. I offset the sedentary nature of my job with a variety of hobbies. I enjoy working with my hands and taking on home improvement projects. I have recenty built a 5*8 foot shed to store garden tools, and am in the process of creating a garage storage system to maxemize the space.
- I love to rock climb, particularly multipitch routes in the wild.
- A long road bike ride is a great way for me to relax
